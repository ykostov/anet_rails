# README

So, welcome to my complete E-Commerce Website called Anet.
Designed with Ruby on Rails, I have used some code from Spree and Solidus.

<h1> USAGE </h1>

1. You need ruby installed and ready, to do that you must:
```gem install rails```.
<br>2. Then clone my repo into your linux machine:
```git clone https://github.com/ykostov/anet_rails.git ```
<br>3. So now you have my website, next step - setup:
```bundle install```
<br>4. Now you must create an admin user:
``` bin/rails generate spree:install ``` <br>
The default values are as follows: <br>
Username: admin@example.com <br>
Password: test 123 <br>
<br>5. Everything is Ready, now let's start the rails server
``` bundle exec rails s ``` or just ```rails s```.
<br>6. Open your browser, and enter the url: localhost:3000.
<br>7. Here you go, you have the e-commerce website of mine :)

<h1> REMEMBER: I DO NOT HAVE RIGHT TO USE ANY OF MY CODE FOR COMMERCIAL PURPROSES ! </H1>
