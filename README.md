So, welcome to my complete E-Commerce Website called Anet.
Designed with Ruby on Rails, I have used some code from Spree and Solidus.

<h1> USAGE </h1>

1. You need ruby installed and ready, to do that you must:
```gem install rails```.
2. Then clone my repo into your linux machine:
```git clone https://github.com/ykostov/anet_rails.git ```
3. So now you have my website, next step - setup:
```bundle install```
4. Now you must create an admin user:
``` bin/rails generate spree:install ```
The default values are as follows:
Username: admin@example.com
Password: test 123
5. Everything is Ready, now let's start the rails server
``` bundle exec rails s ``` or just ```rails s```.
6. Open your browser, and enter the url: localhost:3000.
7. Here you go, you have the e-commerce website of mine :)
